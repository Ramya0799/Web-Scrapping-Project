# Web-Scrapping-Project
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated scripts. This project focuses on developing a web scraper in Python to collect and process data from a target website. The extracted data can be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, market research, price comparison, or content aggregation.

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Python-based web scraper that efficiently retrieves and processes structured or unstructured data from a website. The scraper will handle different elements of a webpage, such as text, images, links, and tables, and store the extracted information in a structured format like CSV, JSON, or a database.

# Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following Python libraries for web scraping and data handling:
* Requests – To send HTTP requests and retrieve webpage content.
* BeautifulSoup – To parse HTML and extract relevant data.
* Selenium – For scraping dynamic content that requires JavaScript execution.
* Pandas – To store and manipulate the extracted data efficiently.
* SQLite / MySQL – To store the scraped data in a structured database (optional).
